## What is this?

This is the source code for my personal blog, [falldowngoboone.com](http://www.falldowngoboone.com).

My plan is simple: build on a file-based CMS like [Kirby](https://getkirby.com). It's lightweight and looks easy to use.

I am working on rebranding alongside this website design, so it may go a little slow at first. My hope is to document the entire process and share it on my blog.

You are free to fork this code and do what you will, although right now there isn't much to look at. Stay tuned if you're interested in the web design process.

## Tooling

Sublime Text 3 - text editor
Sketch - design and layout tool
